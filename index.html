					<li>In the washer drum, on the bottom of clothes</li>

				<ol type="a">
					<li>Water Temperature</li>

					<li>Time</li>
				</ol>

			<br>

			</li>
			<br>
			<li>

				<ol type="a">
					<li>set a timer and pick them up right away when they are done</li>
					<li>set a timer but sometimes I will not pick them up right away</li>
					<li>don't set a timer and pick them up when I remember or when it is convienent for me to pick them

					<li>Other: describe</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

		<li>Sketch and Brief Description of Interface</li>
		<p>
			Washing machine interfaces vary by model and brand but their key components function similarly. The
			interface includes the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Washer Drum + Door</li>
			<li>Dispenser Drawer (if washer is not a top loader)</li>
			<li>Display with cycle selector and options</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="images">
			<img class="washer" src="images/washer.png" atl="Washing Machine">
			<img class="panel" src="images/washer_panel.png" alt="Washing Machine Display Panel">
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>
			A washing machine can be a front loading or a top loading washing machine. User experience differs based on
			the type. For instance, there is no
			dispenser drawer for a top loader and liquid detergent must be added directly on top of clothes. However,
			for a
			front loader, there is a dispenser
			drawer and users add liquid detergent into it. The washing machine displays vary widely based on the make.
			For
			general washing machines at Brown dorms, the options are quite limited with available selections such as
			normal,
			delicates, water temperature, etc. Some washers that are newer do allow for the selection of soil level.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of the overall interface is to load a washing machine with clothes and detergent and select a
			cycle
			to wash the clothes.
		</p>
	</ol>

	<h3>Recording Observations</h3>
	<p class="recObs">
		From my observations, it is obvious that students do not know how to use customizable settings nor their
		purposes. For instance, all the surveyed students do not know what water temperature does to their clothes.
		Moreover, there are two main types of students. The first will always set a timer and pick their clothes up on
		time. The second will not set a timer and may likely not pick their clothes up on time. These are the main
		overarching observations.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h5>Punctuality:</h5>
			<p>From my observations, there are mainly two categories. Some were very punctual about picking up their
				laundries as soon as they were done. These people will even set up a timer for their laundry. Some
				people do not set up a timer and picking them up right away is not a priority for them. Instead they
				take the laundry out when it is convienent for them to do so.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h5>Knowledge of customized settings</h5>
			<p> Most people did not understand the settings and their purposes. For instance, some did not understand
				the purpose of different water temperature settings or what spin level does to their laundry. Instead
				they usually defer to the default settings such as normal or delicates.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h5>Setting time aside for laundry</h5>
			<p>This sort of ties in with the first point about punctuality. Some people purposedly set time aside for
				their laundry while some are trying to fit laundry chores into their already busy schedules. For people
				with busy schedules, some need to be punctual with picking up their laundry so that they can put them in
				the dryer before someone takes it out and put it in a dirty place, further lengthing their already busy
				schedule.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h5>Paid vs. unpaid laundry</h5>
			<p>During my observations, it seems some dorms are undergoing renovations and are not charging for their new
				washers. This leads to some doing their laundry more often than they usually would which leads to less
				loading into a single washer but due to more frequent laundry runs, this also leads to them not being
				punctual with their pick ups.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h5>Transportation of laundry</h5>
			<p>Some students have to bring down their laundry in bags or baskets on huge flights of stairs while some
				easily carry them in elevators. This causes a huge shift in laundry behavior as students who have to use
				the stairs usually only want to take out the laundry as part of another trip (e.g: getting food)</p>
		</li>

	<h3>Different Personas</h3>

	<div class="personas">
		<div class="eachPersonas">
			<h4>Persona 1: Meticulous Marty</h4>
			<p>Meticulous Marty is an upperclassman who has already navigated a confusing freshman year. Today he is
				doing
				his laundry while attending lectures and finishing up his homework so time and preciseness are
				important
				here. He cannot afford to wait for a washer to become available. He also cannot deal with the washer
				transferring colors between clothes or not drying the clothes out properly.
			</p>
			<p> This persona represents the users of my chosen interface, washing machine, by representing students
				who are
				familiar with the dorm washing machines and are punctual with taking their laundry out on time. Even
				though
				they are familiar with the washing machines, they still do not understand some customization
				settings such
				as spin level and water temperature.
			</p>


			<div class="grid">
				<div class="item">
					<h4>Thinks</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Are any of the washers available?</li>
						<li>Did people leave their laundry inside the washer?</li>
						<li>Will I be able to take out my laundry and go to the class in time?</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h4>Feels</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Stressed by the list of things he needs to finish today.</li>
						<li>Anxious about people taking out his laundry and have to restart the whole process.</li>
						<li>Worried about not making to lecture on time.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h4>Says</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Do you know whose laundry this is?</li>
						<li>Hold the elevator!</li>
						<li>Sorry, I'm going to put my stuff in this washer.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h4>Does</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Carries his laundry bag to the laundry area.</li>
						<li>Separates his clothes into different washers.</li>
						<li>Puts the tide pods on the clothes and select a cycle</li>
						<li>Sets a timer to take out his clothes.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

		<div class="eachPersonas">
			<h4>Persona 2: Confused Freshman</h4>
			<p>
				Confused Freshman is as the name suggests, a freshman who has never used college dormitories' washing
				machines. Today he is doing his laundry and his goal is to wash all his piles of clothes in as few
				washing machines as possible so that he can save money. Since today is a weekend, he is not in a rush.
			</p>
			<p>
				This persona represents the other half of the users of my chosen interface, washing machine, by
				representing students who are very unfamiliar with the settings of the washing machine and are not in a
				rush to take their clothes out once its done. These users are also infrequent users of this interface as
				they only do their laundries once every 2 weeks.
			</p>

					</ol>
				</div>

					<ol>
						<li>Carries his laundry bag to the laundry area.</li>
						<li>Loads all of his piles of clothes into the same washer.</li>
						<li>Puts the tide pods on the clothes and selects normal as cycle.</li>
